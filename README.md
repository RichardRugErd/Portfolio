Dice Game Simulation

Project Overview

This Java application simulates two dice games to explore the statistical outcomes and understand their implications from a gambling perspective. Developed as part of the Java Code Challenge for the Junior Java Developer position at Relax Gaming, this project demonstrates not only coding proficiency but also an understanding of probability and its application in gaming.

Games Description
Game 1: Simulates the process of rolling a single die four times, with a win condition of rolling at least one six.
Game 2: Involves rolling a pair of dice twenty-four times. The win condition is rolling at least one double six.
How to Run the Program
To run this program, follow these steps:

Ensure Java (version 15 or later) is installed on your machine.
Clone this repository to your local environment.
Navigate to the folder containing DiceGameSimulation.java.
Compile and execute the file using your preferred IDE or the command line: javac DiceGameSimulation.java && java DiceGameSimulation.
Methodology
The simulation involves a million trials for each game to ensure robust statistical analysis. Java's Random class is utilized for generating random dice outcomes. The program calculates and outputs the mean, variance, and standard deviation for each game, providing insights into their expected profitability and risk.

Results and Interpretation
The simulation results offer intriguing insights into the nature of these games:

Game 1 tends to show a slight average gain for the player.
Game 2, while slightly unfavorable to the player, offers a closer to balanced outcome.
These findings could be instrumental in understanding game design from a casino's perspective.

Future improvements might include:

Enhancing the simulation's performance for an even larger number of trials.
Introducing more complex game scenarios and statistical analysis.
